# Welcome to the IXI Lab GitHub Organization

This document is the official guide for all members of the IXI Lab on how we use GitHub to conduct our research. Our goal is to make our work more **collaborative**, **reproducible**, and **transparent**.

This guide is divided into four parts:
1. **Onboarding Guide for All Members:** Essential first steps for everyone.
2. **The Team Member Handbook:** The day-to-day workflow for contributing to a research project.
3. **The Team Leader Guide:** Responsibilities for those managing a specific project.
4. **The Owner's Manual:** Administrative tasks for the PI and lab managers.

## Part 1: Onboarding Guide for All Members

Welcome to the lab! This section will get you set up and ready to contribute.

### Our Roles

We have three main roles in this organization to keep things running smoothly:

* **Member:** The standard role for all researchers. You will be added to specific project teams to contribute to repositories.
* **Team Leader:** A senior researcher or postdoc responsible for managing a specific project team and its repositories. They are your first point of contact for project-specific questions.
* **Owner:** The PI and designated lab managers. They handle organization-wide settings, billing, and the creation of new projects.

### Your First Steps: A Checklist

1. **Accept Your Invitation:** You will receive an email invitation to join the IXI-Lab organization. Please accept it.
2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** üîê This is **mandatory** for all members. Before you can be added to any projects, you must enable 2FA on your GitHub account for security. Go to your GitHub **Settings > Password and authentication** to enable it.
3. **Get Assigned to a Team:** Once your 2FA is active, an Owner or Team Leader will add you to your project team (e.g., `project-neurovision-team`). This will grant you access to the project's repositories.

### The Golden Rule: Issues and Pull Requests

All work, discussions, and requests in this lab are handled through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

* **Issues:** Used to track tasks, report bugs, ask questions, or propose new ideas. Think of it as our lab's task list and discussion forum.
* **Pull Requests (PRs):** Used to submit your work (code, analysis, manuscript edits) for review before it is merged into the official `main` branch of a project. **Directly pushing to the `main` branch is disabled.**

This system ensures every change is reviewed and documented, which is critical for scientific integrity.

## Part 2: The Team Member Handbook

This is your guide to the daily research workflow.

### The Standard Workflow

Every piece of work, from fixing a typo to adding a new analysis, follows this five-step process:

1. **Find or Create an Issue:** Go to your project repository's "Issues" tab. Find the task you need to work on. If it doesn't exist, create one using our templates (e.g., "üêû Bug Report"). You will be assigned to the issue.
2. **Create a Branch:** From the repository's main page, create a new branch. Name your branch descriptively, including the issue number. For example: `feature/12-add-new-visualization`.
3. **Do the Work & Commit:** Make your changes locally on your new branch. As you work, make small, logical commits with clear messages (e.g., `git commit -m "feat: Add plotting function for trial data"`).
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR):** When your work is ready for review, push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request.
   * The PR template will appear automatically. Please fill it out.
   * In the description, link the issue it resolves by writing `Closes #12`.
   * Assign your Team Leader as a reviewer.
5. **Participate in the Review:** Your Team Leader or another member will review your code. They may approve it or request changes. Respond to comments, make necessary edits, and push the changes to your branch. The PR will update automatically. Once approved, your work will be merged into `main`.

### Data Management Policy

‚ùóÔ∏è **Never commit large data files, credentials, or sensitive information to Git.**

* **Raw Data:** Raw data should be stored on the university server or another designated permanent storage location. The `README.md` in the `/data/` folder should explain how to access it.
* **Large Files:** For medium-sized files that need to be versioned (like a trained model), ask your Team Leader about using Git LFS (Large File Storage).
* **Credentials:** API keys, passwords, and other secrets should never be in your code. Ask a Team Leader about using environment variables or other secure methods.

### Best Practices for Research Code

#### Code Quality Standards

* **Documentation:** Every function should have a clear docstring explaining what it does, its parameters, and return values.
* **Type Hints:** Use Python type hints to make your code more readable and catch errors early.
* **Testing:** Write unit tests for your functions. Aim for at least 80% test coverage.
* **Style:** Follow PEP 8 style guidelines. Use tools like `black` and `flake8` to maintain consistency.

#### Reproducibility Standards

* **Environment Management:** Always include `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` files.
* **Random Seeds:** Set random seeds for all stochastic processes to ensure reproducibility.
* **Version Control:** Commit frequently with descriptive messages.
* **Dependencies:** Pin specific versions of packages in your environment files.

#### Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** Use the provided utility functions in `src/utils.py` for loading and saving data.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Start with the functions in `src/analysis.py` for standard analyses.
3. **Results Management:** Save all results to the `results/` directory with timestamps.
4. **Documentation:** Update the project README and create analysis reports.

### Common Commands and Workflows

#### Setting Up a New Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-name>

# Set up the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate <project-name>

# Install the project package
pip install -e .
```

#### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Start working on a new feature
git checkout -b feature/issue-number-description

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new analysis function"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/issue-number-description
```

#### Updating Your Work

```bash
# Get latest changes from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Update your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-branch
git rebase main
```
